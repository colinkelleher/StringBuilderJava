# StringBuilderJava
## StringBuilderJava with JUnit and build tool ANT
The Builder class should:
1. Provide a class method which constructs a Builder instance which represents an empty
String.
2. Override the toString( ) method. A call to toString( ) should return the String represented by the current Builder instance.
3. Provide an instance method void append( final String that ), which appends that to
the current instanceâ€™s String representation.


The project should implement a main which should (1) create an instance of the Builder class,
(2) append the strings "hello " and "world", (3) converts the current representation of the
Builder instance to String, and (4) prints the resulting String.
